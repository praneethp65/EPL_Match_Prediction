# EPL_Match_Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes football match data and applies predictive modeling to forecast match outcomes based on historical statistics. It utilizes pandas for data manipulation and possibly machine learning models for predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes various match attributes such as:
- Date and time of the match
- Competition and round details
- Venue and match result (Win, Draw, Loss)
- Goals scored (GF) and conceded (GA)
- Opponent team details
- Match statistics (shots, shots on target, expected goals, etc.)

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing match statistics.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding trends and insights through visualizations.
- Predictive Modeling: Implementing machine learning models to predict match results.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
